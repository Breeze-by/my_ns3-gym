# ROS component memory — MR3

Follow `/home/zhuyulab/ns3-workspace/AGENTS.md`. Read the shared
`ns-allinone-3.40/ns-3.40/contrib/opengym/examples/wireless-rl/RESEARCH_PLAN.md`
and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` before research decisions. Current executable
commands are in `launch_commands.md`, actual behavior in `user_guide.md`.

Fixed research team: tb1/tb2/tb3. First centralized joint RL exploration with
stable subgoals and local SLAM/Nav2; later frozen-policy gateway/ns-3 Wi-Fi.
No target search, charging, rally, other robot counts or hardware roadmap.
MR3-P0 was accepted by the user on 2026-10-14; P1A was accepted on 2026-10-15.
P1B implementation/validation is complete, awaiting user acceptance; `f9928fe`
passed same-freeze open/rooms/corridors seed101 scripted adapter audits. See the
[P1B report](../../ns-allinone-3.40/ns-3.40/contrib/opengym/examples/wireless-rl/report/20261015_mr3_p1b.md).
Freeze `5e47802` has 9 effective slots from 10 attempts, including one retained
native infrastructure failure; see the [P1A report](../../ns-allinone-3.40/ns-3.40/contrib/opengym/examples/wireless-rl/report/20261014_mr3_p1a.md).
P1C and later steps remain unstarted; wait for explicit P1B acceptance before P1C.
P1B does not authorize training or gateway. K8/5 s describe the interface version,
not a 95% task proof. The nominal 1 s snapshot timer had 2/3 s rooms gaps;
fixed dt/reset/throughput remain P1C gates.

Active launch/check defaults are three; 1–4 compatibility remains without
new non-three research runs. Explicit MR3 contracts select schema4 evaluation.
Default baseline launches handcrafted control; the mutually exclusive adapter
owns stable goals with logical ideal-delivery copies and no exploration fallback.
No RL policy, gateway or training CLI exists. Historical reports are evidence,
not instructions.

Use system ROS2 Humble Python, preserving PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1; learner conda is
separate. Keep canonical workspace paths, clean owned-process shutdown and
native failure evidence. Do not copy old build/install caches into this tree.

P1B verified ownership/KEEP/commit and ideal navigation copies; complete reset
and fixed-step sampling remain unimplemented. Before networking audit raw
baseline shared inputs, ideal same-process/DDS delivery, action callbacks and truth leakage. Robot
local sensing stays local; cross-robot information obeys actual delivery.
Source ages, physical footprint, contacts and task deadlines cannot be relaxed
to hide failures. Do not introduce a hidden handcrafted exploration fallback.

Every completed change is verified, committed and pushed in-session. Launch
commands/defaults change with launch_commands.md in the same commit. Append
all simulator/training/evaluation attempts, including failures, to the shared
wireless-rl/log.md. After each MR3 substep wait for the user's acceptance.
